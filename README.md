Week 5

Have fun with a friend and play Cycles were you avoid colliding with eath other and grow in length. Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.Players can move up, down, left and right using respective keys:
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.

As the snakes keep moving their body grows and increase in length. Players should try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail. If a player collides with their opponent's trail "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen and the cycles turn white. The players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
